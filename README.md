Welcome to Facebowl, a blogging website where users can create, view, update, and interact with posts and profiles. This React app is built using the latest technologies to provide a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React 18:** A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components, enhancing the development process and enabling efficient rendering.

- **Chakra UI:** A highly customizable component library for React that enables the creation of consistent and attractive user interfaces. Chakra UI provides a collection of accessible and responsive UI components out of the box.

- **TypeScript:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It enhances code quality and maintainability by catching errors early during development and providing better code documentation.

- **GraphQL Client:** GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows you to request specific data from the server. The GraphQL client in this app facilitates communication with the GraphQL server, fetching and sending data efficiently.
